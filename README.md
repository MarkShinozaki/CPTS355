# Assignments 


## [Assignment 0](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Assignments/Assignment0)
### Purpose:

The main purpose of this assignment is to ensure that students can successfully set up their Haskell development environment, write simple Haskell functions, and test these functions using HUnit, a unit testing framework for Haskell.

### Key Topics Covered:

#### 1. Haskell Setup and Configuration:

- Installation and configuration of the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and HUnit library.

#### 2. Basic Haskell Programming:

- Writing and compiling simple Haskell programs.
- Understanding how to load Haskell modules and run Haskell functions using the GHCi (GHC interactive) environment.

#### 3. Unit Testing with HUnit:

- Introduction to the HUnit testing framework for Haskell.
- Writing and running unit tests for Haskell functions.
- Understanding the output of test cases (e.g., cases tried, errors, failures).
