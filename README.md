# Labs 

## [Lab 1 (Haskell)](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Labs/Lab%201)

**Summary**:

- **Purpose**: This lab provides experience in Haskell programming.
- **Focus**: The focus is on practicing basic functional programming concepts using Haskell, such as recursion, list manipulation, and pattern matching.

**Problems Covered**:

#### 1. Insert Function:

- Insert an element at a specific position in a list.
- Learn how to handle list indices and recursion.

#### 2. InsertEvery Function:

- Insert an element at every nth position in a list.
- Understand list manipulation and recursion.

#### 3. GetSales Function:

Calculate total sales for a given day from a list of sales data.
Work with lists of tuples and higher-order functions.

#### 4. SumSales Function:

Sum sales across different stores for a given day.
Further practice with list of tuples and combining results from multiple sources.

#### 5. Split Function:

- Implement custom split logic for lists based on a delimiter.
- Handle recursive splitting without using built-in functions.

#### 6. NSplit Function:

- Split a list up to n times based on a delimiter.
- Control recursion and list slicing.

#### Topics Covered:

- Recursion
- List operations
- Tuple handling
- Higher-order functions (map, fold, filter)
- Custom implementations of standard operations

## [Lab 2 (Haskell)](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Labs/Lab%202)

**Summary**:

- **Purpose**: This lab further strengthens functional programming skills with a focus on recursion, list manipulation, and higher-order functions in Haskell.

- **Focus**: The lab introduces more complex problems that require handling nested data structures, tree manipulations, and the use of algebraic data types.

**Problems Covered**:

#### 1. Merge Functions (merge2, merge2Tail, mergeN):

- Merge two or more lists alternately and handle leftovers.
- Learn tail recursion and folding lists using higher-order functions.

#### 2. Count and Histogram:

- Count occurrences of an item in a list and create histograms.
- Emphasize non-recursive solutions using map, fold, and filter.

#### 3. Concat Functions (concatAll, concat2Either, concat2Str):

- Concatenate nested lists of strings or custom data types.
- Practice working with higher-order functions on complex data types.

#### 4. Tree Operations (evaluateTree, printInfix, createRTree):

- Evaluate and print expression trees in infix order.
- Convert expression trees into result trees, emphasizing tree traversal and manipulation.

#### Topics Covered:

- Tail recursion
- Folding and mapping lists
- Algebraic data types
- Tree traversal and manipulation
- Higher-order functions

## [Lab 3 (Python)](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Labs/Lab%203)

**Summary**:

- **Purpose**: This lab provides experience in Python programming.
- **Focus**: The focus is on using Pythonâ€™s dictionary structures, higher-order functions like map and reduce, and recursion for solving data processing problems.

**Problems Covered**:

#### 1. GetNumCases Function:

- Calculate the total number of cases for given counties during specified months.
- Learn dictionary access and looping through nested dictionaries.

#### 2. GetMonthlyCases Function:

- Reformat data to create a dictionary organized by months.
- Practice dictionary manipulation and data transformation.

#### 3. MostCases Function:

- Find the month with the maximum total number of cases using map and reduce.
- Emphasize functional programming with Python.

#### 4. SearchDicts Functions (searchDicts, searchDicts2):

- Search for keys in a list of dictionaries.
- Implement recursive solutions and handling of linked structures.

#### 5. GetLongest Function:

- Find the longest string in an arbitrarily nested list.
- Recursive processing of nested lists.

#### Topics Covered:

- Dictionary manipulation
- Functional programming (map, reduce)
- Recursion
- Data transformation and searching in nested structures
