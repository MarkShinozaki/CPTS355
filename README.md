# Assignments 


## [Assignment 0](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Assignments/Assignment0)
### Purpose:

The main purpose of this assignment is to ensure that students can successfully set up their Haskell development environment, write simple Haskell functions, and test these functions using HUnit, a unit testing framework for Haskell.

### Key Topics Covered:

#### 1. Haskell Setup and Configuration:

- Installation and configuration of the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and HUnit library.

#### 2. Basic Haskell Programming:

- Writing and compiling simple Haskell programs.
- Understanding how to load Haskell modules and run Haskell functions using the GHCi (GHC interactive) environment.

#### 3. Unit Testing with HUnit:

- Introduction to the HUnit testing framework for Haskell.
- Writing and running unit tests for Haskell functions.
- Understanding the output of test cases (e.g., cases tried, errors, failures).

## [Assignment 1](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS355-ProgramLanguageDesign/tree/Assignments/Assignment1)

### Overview:

The assignment consists of multiple Haskell files, including function implementations and corresponding unit tests. The assignment is structured to guide students through a series of problems that focus on core functional programming concepts using Haskell. The problems are designed to progressively challenge students, reinforcing concepts such as recursion, higher-order functions, list manipulation, and type handling.

### Assignment Breakdown:

#### 1. HW1.hs:

This file likely contains the implementations of the functions required for the assignment. Each problem is expected to be solved using Haskell's functional programming paradigms, including recursion, pattern matching, and higher-order functions.

#### 2. HW1Tests.hs and P1_HW1Tests.hs to P6_HW1Tests.hs:

These files are test scripts written using HUnit, a unit testing framework for Haskell. Each of these test files corresponds to a specific problem in the assignment (P1 to P6), providing automated tests to ensure that the solutions implemented in HW1.hs work correctly.
The tests help students verify the correctness of their code by comparing the output of their functions to the expected results.

### Summary of Topics Covered:

#### 1. Recursion:

- The problems likely require recursive approaches to solve, which is a fundamental concept in functional programming. Recursion replaces traditional iterative loops and is essential for processing lists and other data structures in Haskell.

#### 2. Higher-Order Functions:

- Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results are central to Haskell programming. This assignment may include problems that utilize functions like map, fold, and filter.

#### 3. List Manipulation:

- Many functional programming problems involve processing lists. Students are expected to manipulate lists, apply transformations, and accumulate results using both built-in and custom functions.

#### 4. Pattern Matching:

- Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Haskell that simplifies the process of handling different data structures or conditions. It is likely used throughout the assignment to decompose data structures and handle edge cases.

#### 5. Type Handling:

- Understanding and using Haskellâ€™s strong, static type system is critical. The problems likely emphasize defining functions with specific types, ensuring type safety, and leveraging type inference.

#### 6. Unit Testing with HUnit:

- The test files provide an opportunity to practice writing and running unit tests. Understanding how to create test cases and interpret the results is crucial for verifying the correctness of Haskell code.

#### 1. Problem 1: group_items (Tail-Recursive) - 10%

- **Task**: Implement a function that groups items in a list based on increasing group sizes.

- **Example**:
```
> group_items [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
[[1],[2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9,10],[11,12]]
```
- **Concepts Covered**: Tail recursion, list processing, and grouping algorithms.

#### 2. Problem 2: `get_latest_nested` (Higher-Order Function) - 10%

- **Task**: Find the most recent date from a nested list of dates without using recursion.
Example:

```
> get_latest_nested [[(31,8,2022),(20,7,2023)], [(1,10,2023)], [(6,7,2023)]]
(1,10,2023)
```

- **Concepts Covered**: Higher-order functions (`map`, `foldr`, `filter`), list manipulation.

#### 3. Problem 3: study_list (Higher-Order Function) - 12%

- **Task**: Given a study log, find all courses studied on a specific day using higher-order functions.

- **Example**:

```

["CptS355", "CptS322"]
```

- **Concepts Covered**: Data filtering, list processing with higher-order functions.

#### Problem 4: IEither Data Type Manipulations

- Part (a): `either_sum1` (Recursive Solution) - 7%

IInt 12
```
- Part (b): `either_sum2` (Higher-Order Solution) - 7%
  - **Task**: Perform the same summation using higher-order functions instead of recursion.

- Part (c): `either_filter1` (Recursive Solution) - 7%
  - **Task**: Filter elements from nested lists based on a criterion using recursion.
